Using the Dataset from https://www.synapse.org/Synapse:syn3193805/wiki/217789

The dataset was already preprocessed and downloaded from here:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ACJEoTp-uqfFJ73qS3eUObQh52nGuzCd

I'm  currently downloading the dataset from my Google Cloud in the current setup.

Setup:
Google Colab L4 GPU (Google Colab Subscription is needed)
Otherwise, you can just run the Jupyter Notebook after getting the dataset.

Currently it contains 3 different U-net architectures:
1) Basic one
2) U-net with 1 attention channel
3) U-net with double attention channel

I saved each model after training, so you can just go straight to the testing portion of the assignment after uploading the model to Colab
1) unet_SCC_model.h5  ----  U-net run with just the Sparse Cross-Entropy Loss
2) unet_SGD_model.h5  ----  U-net run with Combined Loss = Dice Loss + Sparce Cross-Entropy Loss + using SGD optimizer (momentum=0.9, lr = 0.001)
3) unet_combined_Adam_model.h5 ---- U-net run with Combined Loss + Adam Optimizer (lr = 0.001)
4) unet_single_model.h5 ---- U-net run with Combined Loss + 1 attention gate + Adam Optimizer
5) unet_attention_model.h5 ---- U-net run with Combined Loss + double attention gate + Adam Optimizer

There are 2 ways to evaluate at the end of the file:
1) Just calculation of the Hausdorff Distance and DSC
2) Calculation of Haursdorff Distance and DSC after applying CRF
